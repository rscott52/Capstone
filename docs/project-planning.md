## Write a Definition Statement
I want to build an application that helps end users convert measurements into the specific measurement type they need, Imperial or Metric. This application would provide conversions for volume, length, tools, weight, and speed. There would also be a brief history of the different measurement systems; how they were created, how they were developed and how they became popular or declined. I also want to build a portion that teaches people how to read certain measurements or tools like a tape measure.

## Define Your Audience
I believe my audience will be individuals that like to cook and use recipes that may be in different systems or standards. I think it will also be individuals that like to do “Do It Yourself (DIY)” projects that need help with different tool measurements or systems. It would also be useful for individuals that need help with international traveling and speed limits. Lastly, it will be helpful for individuals that do not know how to read measurements.

## Outline the Contents of the Application

### What do I want on each page?
I want to have two separate calculators, one for each measurement system. I would also like to have a picture, or pdf, that is printable with a list of basic conversions. I would also like to have links to go to back to the home page, contact page and about me page on each page. I would like to have a logo or emblem for each system on the page as well. I also would like to have a picture generated whenever the measurement is converted.

### What do I want the functionality of each page to be?
I would like to be able to have the calculators work for each system. It would be ideal to be able to either type the numbers in or click on the calculator buttons. I would also like to have a brief saved history of past calculations. I think it would be cool to have some sort of transition of color or highlight on the home page. I want to have a hamburger Icon on the home page for displaying the different navigable pages. I want to have the basic conversion PDF on each page printable.  I also think it would be awesome to have a speedometer, measuring cups or utensils and different tools shown whenever they conversion is completed. I would also like to have a tape measure and any other tool needed when showing how to read measurements.

### What is the purpose of my application?
The purpose of my application is to hopefully help individuals with understanding what measurement they are needing to use based on the conversion they are inputting. Another purpose would be to show why each type of measurement is used and how accurate they are.

### What business problem or real-world problem am I going to be solving?
I know personally, I struggle with conversions. I think in general, we are accustomed to using the Imperial system, but the rest of the world uses metric. I think a simple website with the ability to not only complete the conversions, but to also tell the importance of them, would be a great help to a lot of people. I know there are apps and other sites that already do this, but I think it would be a great project to create and make it as simplistic as possible while providing next level features and aesthetics.

## Define the Attributes of your Website

### Color Palette
I know we are only supposed to have 3-4 colors, so I am trying to narrow down my selection.
•	#FBF7F4 (Isabelline)
•	#96E2ED (New Photo Blue)
•	#DE8F3F (Butterscotch)
•	#403D39 (Black Olive)
•	#354F52 (Dark Slate Gray)

### Images
I still have to find the images I need to use. I will need to find a picture of each measuring system and pictures for the tape measure and measuring utensils.

### Fonts
I will most likely be using the Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif font family.

### Logos
I am going to try and develop an overall logo for the home page, and then maybe a smaller logo for each type of measurement (volume, mass, length, speed and tools).

### Navigation
The navigation on the site will be straightforward. It will be the home page with a hamburger Icon that expands to show the different pages available. Once you click on one of the pages you will be taken to the page and the different type of converters will be displayed. You will be able to scroll slightly to see the brief history and then there will be links to the home, about and contact pages.

## List Applications Researched: (links to websites / applications)
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_units_of_measurement

- https://www.unitconverters.net/
- https://www.metric-conversions.org/
- https://www.exploratorium.edu/food/measurements

### List what you like about each site:
For calculator.net, I like that you select your unit category, then your unit type to convert from and to, and you lastly enter the amount you are wanting to convert from, and it automatically gives you the converted amount. I also like the fact that they have a brief history of the system, and they talk about the differences.

For unitconverters.net, I like the simplistic layout of the site. I also like that they have some common conversions hyperlinked. I also like that they have a brief information section to inform the user of some background and context for the conversions.

For metric-conversions.org, I like that all of the conversion categories are right there and viewable on the home page. I also like the information sections and that they have some common conversion hyperlinks. The simplicity of the site is nice as well.

For the exploration.edu/food/measurements, I like that they offer a calculator, but they also have the quick breakdown of the common conversion amounts. They also have a brief information section which talks about the difference between dry and liquid volumes and has a brief history of the systems. I really like the layout and look of the site as well.

### List what you do not like about each site:
For calculator.net, I don’t like that they have financial, fitness & health and math as other categories. It is handy for individuals that need assistance with those subjects, but it clutters up the website.

For unitconverter.net, I don’t like the layout of the website with all the different hyperlinks. I am also not a big fan of the color palette they use, but that is more personal preference than anything important.

For metric-conversions.org, it is neat that they have an app for phones, but I don’t like that you have to have the app instead of the site being more mobile friendly. I also don’t like that there is no pdf or picture of common conversions, but instead everything is hyperlinked.

For the exploration.edu/food/measurements, I don’t like that the calculator is a hyperlink and not on the same page as the measurements page. I also wish the common conversion table was printable or a pdf. I also don’t like that the site only has the conversions for food and cooking, but it seems the site specifically for that, so it makes since.

## How my application will be different:
My application will be more simplistic and will only focus on measurement conversions. I also want my application to be mobile focused first and foremost so that it is easily accessible to everyone. I also want to provide a pdf of common conversion values and explain how the conversion is found. I am going to do my very best to have all important information directly on the page so I can avoid hyperlinks as much as possible. I would also like to have a feature that allows you to save your own common conversions.
